# DS-Progress-Journal

Template for a beginner project in the UCSB Data Science Club.

Allows members to log progress in an interactive visualization using Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, and mplcursors.

## Overview 

Being in an academic club like the Data Science Club is very appealing to potential employers. However, one issue with the large number of people listing "UCS Data Science Club" on their resum√© is that it can be difficult to quantify the amount of progress made or knowledge gained in this extracurricular club.

This short project intends to help those motivated and driven members of the club to track their weekly progress in a matplotlib visualization, while in the process also gaining knowledge of git commands.


## Create Github Repository
We'll be using this Git Cheat Sheet to help us out. [Git Sheet](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)

### 1. Create GitHub account (if you haven't already) 
### 2. Link GitHub account to terminal/shell
  - In the future, we want to be able to interact with our GitHub scripts through our terminal. In order to do this, we need to point git (the programming language upon which GitHub is based on) to our account.
  - Run `git config --global user.name "Your name here"` and `git config --global user.email "Your email here"` in your terminal.
  - To ensure these config commands worked, run `git config user.name`
