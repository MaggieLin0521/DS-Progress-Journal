# DS-Progress-Journal

Template for a beginner project in the UCSB Data Science Club.

Allows members to log progress in an interactive visualization using Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, and mplcursors.

# Overview 

Being in an academic club like the Data Science Club is very appealing to potential employers. However, one issue with the large number of people listing "UCS Data Science Club" on their resum√© is that it can be difficult to quantify the amount of progress made or knowledge gained in this extracurricular club.

This short project intends to help those motivated and driven members of the club to track their weekly progress in a matplotlib visualization, while in the process also gaining knowledge of git commands.
